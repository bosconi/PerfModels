Performance Scalability Models

This is some software to aid performance scalability analysis.  It includes:

	gnuplot-linear		Linear scalability model
	gnuplot-amdahl		Amdahl's law scalability
	gnuplot-usl		Universal Scalabitily Law
	r-scale.r		Scalability Models (Amdahl, USL)
	r-util-md1.r		Queueing Theory M/D/1 mean response time vs util
	data.txt		Sample input file for scalability modeling

There are more projects rather than stand-alone tools; expect to customize them
for each system you are modeling, and these assume you already understand
performance scalability analysis.
