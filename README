Performance Scalability Models

This is some software to aid performance scalability analysis.  It includes:

	linear.g		Linear scalability model
	amdahl.g		Amdahl's law scalability
	usl.g			Universal Scalabitily Law
	scale.r			Scalability Models (Amdahl, USL)
	util-md1.r		Queueing Theory M/D/1 mean response time vs util
	data.txt		Sample input file for scalability modeling
	da/			Distribution Analysis

There are more projects rather than stand-alone tools; expect to customize them
for each system you are modeling, and these assume you already understand
performance scalability analysis.
