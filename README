Performance Scalability Models

This is some software to aid performance scalability analysis.  It includes:

	gnuplot-linear		Linear scalability model
	gnuplot-amdahl		Amdahl's law scalability
	gnuplot-usl		Universal Scalabitily Law
	data.txt		sample input file

There are more projects rather than stand-alone tools; expect to customize them
for each system you are modeling, and these assume you already understand
performance scalability analysis.
